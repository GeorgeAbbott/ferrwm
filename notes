CHECK
    Window - is this an X type?

For drw_scm_create
    In dwm.c an array is created to hold the scheme, and what drw_scm_create
    does is creates a ret, of size of three XftColors, and calls clr_create
    for each of these. 

    clr_create  -> create an Xft
    scm_create  -> For (fg,bg,border) creates Xfts for each by calling 
                   clr_create, then returns this array of 3. 


    dwm         -> allocates space for LENGTH(colors) * sizeof(Clr*)
                   then creates a list of schemes, where each scheme
                   created is done by passing in clrnames for that 
                   element (where clrnames is a list of 3, and iterated
                   over in scm_create to call clr_create on each of those.

    In Rust:
        create_color    fn (&self, clrnames: &[String]) -> Result<Clr>
        create_scheme   fn (&self, clrnames: &[String]) -> Result<&[Clr]>

    In dwm then, the return from create_scheme can be assigned to the 
    relevant position in scheme variable which will be array of arrays of 
    XftColor (as multiple schemes and each scheme is 3 colors).
